In the end you'll pray the ghost
And wherever you will run to And wherever you may hide
They will be always stay, my friend
From the evil by it self
Mr sinister, Mr sinister, Mr sinister
It can be nowhere
The time will say you what I know
The time is over
And now you wait love in your door
Come hear the whisper, Mr sinister, Mr sinister
Mr sinister, Mr sinister, Mr sinister
Alright
