You got your hands to raise your fist
See the laughter from its raise
Can you resist me little sister
Can you resist the devil's raise
And whatever God may tell you
Every soul would have its praise
One day youâ€™ll come to sell me yours my dear
And the time has come to us Mr sinister, Mr sinister Mr sinister
Alright
Come hear the whisper from the sinner
From the son and only ghost
and devouring love in heaven
